# FacialKeypointDetection

Context: I completed this guided programming exercise as a part of the Udacity course titled Introduction to Computer Vision.

The Jupyter notebooks present the procedures I followed to build a facial keypoint detection system. Notebook one records the image processing steps. Notebook two records the steps I took to build, train, and test a convolutional neural network (CNN). This CNN can detect facial keypoints in facial images. Notebook three combines OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers, which detect all faces (regions of interest) in an image, with the CNN, which detects the facial keypoints in each region of interest.

Due to their large sizes, the directories titled images and saved_models (which contain the optimum weights/parameters I found) are not in this repository.
